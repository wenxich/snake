SNAKE GAME by Wenxi Chen
=============

Hi. For a final project, I used the concepts of collections, file I/O, inheritance/subtyping, and JUnit to create a simple Snake game with Java Swing.

The general idea and rules behind this game are explained in instructions.jpg. I will also add them below:

"Welcome to Snake. You get to control a snake.

Use the [LEFT] [UP] [RIGHT] [DOWN] keys to move your snake.

RED apples will make your snake grow longer.
Collecting them will give you 1 point each.

GOLDEN apples will make your snake move faster.
Collecting them will give you 5 points each.

Try not to let your snake hit a wall or itself,
or it will die and your game will be over.

Click RESET to start, and have fun!"
