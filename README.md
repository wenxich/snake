Snake!
=============

Hi. For a final project, I used the concepts of collections, file I/O, inheritance/subtyping, and JUnit to create a simple Snake game with Java Swing.

The general idea and rules behind this game are explained in instructions.jpg. I will also add them below:

> Welcome to Snake. You get to control a snake.
>
> Use the **[LEFT] [UP] [RIGHT] [DOWN]** keys to move your snake.
>
> **RED** apples will make your snake grow longer.
Collecting them will give you 1 point each.
>
> **GOLDEN** apples will make your snake move faster.
Collecting them will give you 5 points each.
>
> Try not to let your snake hit a wall or itself,
or it will die and your game will be over.
>
> Click **RESET** to start, and have fun!
